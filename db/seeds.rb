                necessary with tongs or a long fork to keep the noodles separate and help them soften evenly. Drain the

                you do when making an omelet, until the eggs are mostly set, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Remove the pan from the

                undisturbed for 15 seconds then scoop them in toward the center. Toss the noodles gently then spread them
                out again. Pour about 1/3 of the seasoning sauce around the edges of the pan, and continue stir-frying the
