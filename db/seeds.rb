                1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes,
                1/3 cup of dry white wine, 1/2 lemon juice,

                Season the shrimp with salt, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

                butter and 1/2 cup of the reserved cooking water. Continue to cook, tossing, until the butter
                is melted and the shrimp is hot, about 2 minutes, adding more of the reserved cooking water as needed. Season with salt; stir in the parsley.
                Serve with lemon wedges. ",

                a little spicy and crunchy. Cooking a larger piece makes for a nice presentation.
                Topped with buttery golden breadcrumbs and parsley,
                it's perfect for a weeknight dinner yet fancy enough to serve to guests.",

  instructions: "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil. Mix the brown sugar, paprika,
                garlic powder, cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoon kosher salt and a generous amount of freshly ground black
                pepper in a small bowl. Mix the panko with the parsley, butter, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt and a few
                grinds of black pepper in another small bowl. Then Place the salmon skin-side down on the prepared
                baking sheet and spread the surface with the Dijon. Press the brown sugar mixture all over the
                salmon then top with the breadcrumb mixture. Crimp all four sides of the foil to create a border
                around the salmon, this will help collect the juices so they don't spread and burn. Bake until the
                breadcrumbs are golden brown, and the salmon is firm and flakes easily when pressed, 15 to 18 minutes.
