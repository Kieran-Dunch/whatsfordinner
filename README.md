What's For Dinner is a web application by Thomas Baumann, Huang Shuwei, Claire Conrardy and Kieran Dunch.

It was created from scratch over the course of two weeks in Spring 2022, as the final project of Le Wagon's web Development Bootcamp in Montr√©al. 

The following is a loose outline of each member's specialty during the project, and their personal highlights:

- Claire Conrardy: UI/UX Designer, Front-End Developer



- Huang Shewei: Full-Stack Developer



- Thomas Baumann: Back-End Developer



- Kieran Dunch: Product Manager, Full-Stack Developer

Many thanks to the LeWagon Team for providing a strong teaching foundation, and to @Stephlaf, our Batch owner and lead teacher.
